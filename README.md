# Weather App
A Java app that displays historical weather information in a graph form for specific cities and dates. Users can download online weather records and view them as graphs on a GUI. 

## Running the application
The app can be run on any IDE such as IntelliJ. The starting point of the app is the main() function in the WeatherController.java
file.
However the app use the Wunderground API which no longer returns data on a free basis. Thus the app returns an error message
if it is run now. If you wish to see a sample of the graph output that used to be returned, please invoke the app in test mode by running the main()
function from the OutputView.java file.

## Notes
The app was developed in 2013 as part of a University assignment for an 'Object Oriented Programming and Software Design' course.
The code was meant to be purely functional, so please forgive the lack of clean code :{
